# VideoGame-Inventory
This is a practice project created for The <a href='theodinproject.com'>Odin Project</a>, using Express, nodeJS, Jade, express-validator, and many other modules. Taking some inspirations from other submissions and websites, I have created my own video game inventory system where you can CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) various Video Game titles with properties such as Genre. 
This first test iteration is for anime instead of video games. I will later convert everything to video games and possibly set up the site for use on Heroku.

To run on the Windows CMD prompt, use this command:
	SET DEBUG=VideoGame-Inventory:* & npm start
